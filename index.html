              <p>On an unnamed Earth-like super-continent planet, powerful monsters and villains have been mysteriously appearing and causing disasters. To combat them, the world's government created a Hero Association that employs superheroes to stop violent creatures and villains. The heroes are ranked from Class-C to Class-S. Saitama was an unassociated hero, hailing from the metropolis of City-Z, who performed heroic deeds for his own entertainment. He has trained himself to the point where he broke his "limiter" and can effortlessly defeat any opponent with a single punch. However, Saitama has lately become bored with his superhuman powers, and frustrated at the complete lack of challenge from fighting.</p>
              <p>Over the course of the series, Saitama encounters various superheroes, friends, villains, and monsters. He quickly gains a pupil, the cyborg Genos, who is on a revenge quest to find another cyborg that slaughtered his entire family and hometown. Eventually, the two join the Hero Association in order to gain recognition. Genos proves to be a prodigy and is instantly placed in Class-S, while Saitama barely passes to Class-C due to the written test. Saitama performs many feats that go mostly unnoticed and unappreciated by the public, mostly due to his rank. Saitama is promoted to Class-B after he defeats the powerful Deep Sea King, who rains destruction on City-J. Rumors have it that strong monsters are meeting up in City-Z.</p>
